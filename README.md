Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the performance of a motor under varying conditions by measuring thrust, RPM, voltage, and current. The tests were conducted using two types of propellers—plastic and carbon—as well as two types of batteries: 3S1P and 4S1P.

Objectives
Thrust Measurement: Determine the amount of thrust generated by the motor with different propeller and battery combinations.
RPM Measurement: Record the motor's RPM (revolutions per minute) under varying conditions to assess performance efficiency.
Voltage Monitoring: Monitor the voltage supplied to the motor to understand the electrical demands for each setup.
Current Measurement: Measure the current drawn by the motor to evaluate power consumption and efficiency.
Experimental Setup
Propellers:

Plastic Propeller
Carbon Propeller
Batteries:

3S1P Battery
4S1P Battery
Motor:

Standard brushless motor commonly used in RC models.
Measurement Tools:

Thrust stand
RPM meter
Voltage sensor
Current sensor
Methodology
Initial Setup:

Mount the motor onto a thrust stand.
Attach the chosen propeller (plastic or carbon) to the motor.
Connect the motor to either the 3S1P or 4S1P battery.
Measurement Process:

Power on the motor and gradually increase the throttle to maximum.
Record the thrust, RPM, voltage, and current at various throttle levels.
Repeat the measurements for each combination of propeller and battery type.
Data Analysis:

Compare the performance metrics (thrust, RPM, voltage, current) across different propeller and battery combinations.
Analyze the efficiency and performance benefits of using different materials for propellers and varying voltage levels with different battery types.
Results
The results section will include data tables and graphs showing the relationship between propeller material, battery type, and the measured parameters (thrust, RPM, voltage, current).
